# Commun.io
Passively Networking

## Vision
Our App aims to:

- provide one to one social media exchange
- allow the broadcast of social media information
- permit the filtering of incoming data based on defined preferences

It is directed towards:
    
  - conference attendees seeking to expand their network
- recruiters looking for specialized people
- communities intending to broaden their audience
  
The atendees will benefit from maximizing their networking opportunities, as they will be equipped with the means to easily exchange their social media information.

Conferences, on the other hand, will profit from their now enhanced ability to form a densely connected community out of their audience, at a very small cost to themselves.

## Elevator Pitch
